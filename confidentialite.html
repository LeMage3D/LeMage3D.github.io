My application "A Saner Life", also written "ASanerLife" does not collect any data, it doesn't even connect on any network.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Evreything is stored in the file "save.ini" located "[Your mobile or SD card]/Android/data/com.LeMage3D.ASanerLife/".

Yep you can cheat just by editing this file and I'm a noob at programming.
<br></br>
But it's quite cool for users also.
